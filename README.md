This is a very vestigal effort to "rewrite" my well-known tcell (for Go)
project into D.

I expect that this is completely useless to anyone at present.
When/if this changes, I'll update this README.
In the meantime this repository is probably most useful for humor
if one wants to observe my learnings with a new language.

This effort is being done principally to learn D, but hopefully it may
someday later be useless because it appears that D does not have an
analog for tcell.
