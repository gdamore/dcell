/**
 * MouseEvent represents a single pressed key, possibly with modifiers.
 * It is sent on either mouse up or mouse down events.  It is also sent on
 * mouse motion events - if the terminal supports it.
 *
 * We make every effort to ensure that mouse release events are delivered.
 * Hence, click drag can be identified by a motion event with the mouse down,
 * without any intervening button release.  On some terminals only the initiating
 * press and terminating release event will be delivered.
 *
 * Mouse wheel events, when reported, may appear on their own as individual
 * impulses; that is, there will normally not be a release event delivered
 * for mouse wheel movements.
 *
 * Most terminals cannot report the state of more than one button at a time --
 * and some cannot report motion events unless a button is pressed.
 *
 * Applications can inspect the time between events to resolve double or triple
 * clicks.
